# Rust Port Status

C++ (`../src/`) and `content/` are read-only parity oracles; commits are the
record of completed slices.

## Focus

Engine virtual-play completes Tutorials 01–10. App-keyboard routes complete
01–07 and select Tutorial 08. Finish exact tutorial
presentation/interaction before resuming Goldrush at its pinned frame-3327
Decay/DoCon mismatch.

## Gates

```sh
cargo nextest run -p lc-engine -E 'test(/^(real_tutorial(0[1-9]|10)_(virtual_play|route)|real_tutorial02_balloon_platform)::/)'
cargo nextest run -p lc-engine -E 'test(/^virtual_player_harness::/)'
cargo nextest run -p lc-app -E 'test(/app_virtual_keyboard_(completes|flings|opens)/)'
cargo nextest run --workspace --no-fail-fast
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo xtask engine-snapshots verify
cargo xtask parity verify
```

Behavior changes also require the relevant scenario sweep/audit and rebuilt
live comparison.

## Open

- Tutorial/UI: C++-exact menus, HUD, evaluation, rendering, audio, and
  startup/options interaction.
- Gameplay: exact landscape/material/PXS behavior, liquids, blasts, weather,
  movement/collision/attachment, vehicles, lines, containers, and callback
  order.
- Systems: strict C4Value/save semantics, synchronized controls/networking,
  configuration/localization, and group I/O.

Comparator caveats: presentation RNG is opt-in; fields compare only when both
bridges expose them. Tutorial 07's seed-zero Surface8 is byte-identical; broader
same-seed landscape coverage remains incomplete.

## Preserve

Preserve fixed-point sync boundaries, shared RNG state/count, reverse
execution, IDs and list ordering, callback/effect timing, movement rules,
script include order, save state, masks, scenario-init RNG, and crew/find ties.
